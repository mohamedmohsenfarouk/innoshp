# Innoshop

- I setup Predis library from composer then called it in my plugin php file

- Created Dummy products from Woocommerce

- Cached the products then draw them on Home page

- Made the plugin only apply on homepage

- Made a flush button but it has some problem I didn't have time to fix it so I commented it on the code

- I know what's the folder structure to the plugin should be but I had no time for it because I have alot on tasks on my work this days

- This is the correct folder structure
- /plugin-name
-    plugin-name.php
-    uninstall.php
-    /languages
-    /includes
-    /admin
-         /js
-         /css
-         /images
-    /public
-         /js
-         /css
-         /images
